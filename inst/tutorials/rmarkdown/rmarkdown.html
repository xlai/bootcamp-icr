<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>This tutorial builds on the Markdown session by introducing R Markdown, a tool for creating documents using R.</p>
<div id="section-learning-objectives" class="section level3">
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>Upon completion of this session, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create an R Markdown file;</li>
<li>include values, figures and tables generated from R objects;</li>
<li>compile to Word, PDF and HTML formats;</li>
<li>explore creating other documents like tutorials, presentations, and web apps.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-the-r-markdown-format" class="section level2">
<h2>The R Markdown format</h2>
<p>Markdown documents are simply text files that provide rich formatting using simple commands. The files take the extension <code>.md</code>. We previously learned that Markdown documents can be compiled to Word, PDF and HTML formats (amongst others) using pandoc.</p>
<p>R Markdown is a related format using the <code>.Rmd</code> extension that allows users to knit in data and images from an R session to create a wide range of output formats, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML web pages</li>
<li>Word documents</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> files and PDFs</li>
<li>PowerPoint, Beamer and HTML slides</li>
<li>Journal articles</li>
<li>Interactive Shiny apps and tutorials (including this tutorial!)</li>
<li>R package and GitHub documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>As this list makes clear, R Markdown is an incredibly flexible and powerful tool. Its value to us as statisticians is that it allows us to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>quickly create documents</li>
<li>that convey analysis of data</li>
<li>combining text, tables, plots, and equations, etc</li>
<li>in formats that are familiar to readers</li>
</ol>
<p>As the name suggests, the cornerstone of R Markdown is the underlying Markdown format. Ultimately, document conversion is conducted using pandoc but RStudio handles that for us.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown-resources" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown resources</h2>
<p>There are lots of examples on the web about learning R Markdown. You will undoubtedly find those useful as you learn new things. For now we will start with an introductory video from one of the best providers of R markdown, the RStudio website:</p>
<p><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html" class="uri">https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html</a></p>
<p>We will demonstrate lots of the features by building an R Markdown document in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-creating-and-compiling-your-first-document" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating and compiling your first document</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a new R Markdown file in RStudio by clicking R -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown. This opens a dialogue box.</li>
<li>You can specify a Title and Author is you wish but this can easily be changed later.</li>
<li>There are options to select the output format. Select HTML and click OK. This creates a file with some default content.</li>
<li>Click the Knit button in the title bar. This will prompt you to save the file. Once you save the file, the document will compile and you will be presented with the output in a web browser.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You just created an HTML file from an R Markdown file</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice that there is an R chunk that says simply <code>summary(cars)</code> followed by some R output. The code was executed and the reply from R was sticthed into the document by RStudio. Further down there is an R plot. That was produced by another chunk of R code.</p>
<div id="section-word-version" class="section level3">
<h3>Word version</h3>
<p>Notice the little downward arrow next to the Knit button. From that dropdown, select <em>Knit to Word</em>. This creates a Word document from the same input <code>Rmd</code> file. Same headers, same text, same figure, but output to Word rather than HTML.</p>
<p>Notice in what is called the <strong>YAML header</strong> at the top (which contains instructions to RStudio on how to build the document) that the output type now contains <code>word_document</code>. Using the same method, we can build to other formats. For now we will proceed in HTML: delete the line that says <code>word_document: default</code>.</p>
<p>The following sections add further embellishments to this document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-r-markdown-content" class="section level2">
<h2>R Markdown Content</h2>
<p>In these sections we will report on the <code>tumours</code> dataset contained in the <code>bootcamp</code> package.</p>
<div id="section-the-setup-chunk" class="section level3">
<h3>The setup chunk</h3>
<p>The first chunk in your file looks like this:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```</code></pre>
<p>This is called the setup chunk. It plays a special role because it contains code that should be run to prepare resources for the rest of the document.</p>
<p>In yours, edit it so it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(bootcamp)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```</code></pre>
<p>This will ensure that the <code>bootcamp</code> package is loaded so that the other chunks will be able to access the <code>tumours</code> dataset. It also loads the <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code> packages because we will use those too.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-clean-slate" class="section level3">
<h3>Clean slate</h3>
<p>Get rid of everything in your Rmd file below the setup chunk. We will start from a clean slate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-inline-statistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Inline statistics</h2>
<p>We are reporting on the <code>tumours</code> dataset mirroring the way that we in CRCTU might report on a clinical trial. By way of introduction for the reader, let us imagine that we want to add a sentence that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trial assessed n1 patients at n2 timepoints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could hard-code the values for <span class="math inline">\(n1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n2\)</span>. However, far prefereble is that those values would be calculated by R. That way, our report will be accurate whatever snapshot is used. Luckily, R markdown can include such <em>inline statistics</em>.</p>
<p>Do you remember the <code>dplyr</code> commands we encountered in an earlier tutorial? We are going to use them again. Add to your document the line</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trial assessed N1 patients at <code>`r tumours %&gt;% distinct(Time) %&gt;% nrow`</code> timepoints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that this does not need to go inside an R chunk; it just goes in the document as demonstrated. The <code>`r command`</code> bit creates a mini inline chunk that is swapped for whatever the command happens to resolved to. You can probably work out that the R command in our example will evaluate to the number of distinct times observed in the dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: edit the example in your document so that the number of patients is calculated too.</p>
<p>Obviously this method of adding data inline only makes sense for small pieces of information. Larger objects like figures and tables are handled by chunks. They are the topics of the next two Sections.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Plots</h2>
<p>To add a figure to your diagram, simply add an R chunk that yields a plot, like this:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
tumours %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = TumourSize)) + 
  geom_point()
```</code></pre>
<p>The parameters <code>fig.width</code> and <code>fig.height</code> control the width and height of the figure. Often it is useful to have this level of control.</p>
<p>If you want to see the plot without the R code that produced it, simply set <code>echo = FALSE</code> in the plot chunk:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
tumours %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = TumourSize)) + 
  geom_point()
```</code></pre>
<p>If you want to add a caption to the figure, you use:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = &#39;Tumour assessments through time.&#39;}
tumours %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = TumourSize)) + 
  geom_point()
```</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: add the plot to your document. Add a sentence or two before the plot to explain what is coming. Add lines to the diagram joining the observations of individuals, coloured by treatment arm. Feel free to add a smoother or use <code>facet_wrap</code> if you feel that makes the results clearer. Refer to the earlier sessions if you need to!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-tables" class="section level2">
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>To format an R <code>data.frame</code> as table in an R markdown file, simply run it through the <code>knitr::kable</code> function. For instance:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = &#39;Tumour assessments through time.&#39;}
tumours %&gt;% 
  group_by(Arm) %&gt;% 
  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;% 
  knitr::kable()
```</code></pre>
<p>The same works for objects like <code>tibble</code> that behave like data-frames.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: add the table to your document. Edit the example to calculate the mean and standard-deviation for each arm at each time-point.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-equations" class="section level2">
<h2>Equations</h2>
<p>Equations can be added by wrapping <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> expressions in pairs of single dollar signs for inline equations:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>The sample mean is $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$</code></pre>
<p>to produce</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sample mean is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\mu} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and pairs of double dollar signs for whole-line equations:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>and the sample variance is $$\left\{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right\} - \hat{\mu}^2$$</code></pre>
<p>to produce</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and the sample variance is <span class="math display">\[\left\{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 \right\} - \hat{\mu}^2\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: add the equation for Euler’s identity to your document.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-other-content" class="section level2">
<h2>Other content</h2>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Change the author in the YAML header to be you.</p>
<p>All of the content we learned in the markdown session will also work in R markdown.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Add some section headers to your document. Also add a list, just because. Add a link at the bottom so that readers can email you if they have a question. Bonus points if you can work out how to automatically set the subject line of the email.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-compilation" class="section level2">
<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>Compile your document to:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>Word</li>
<li>and PDF</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <a href="mailto:k.brock@bham.ac.uk?subject=rmarkdown">email your finished examples</a> to Kristian.</p>
